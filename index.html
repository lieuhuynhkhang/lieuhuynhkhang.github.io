                          Our group consists of 4 members: Khang, Quang, Kiên and Minh. All of us are quite new to IT and this is our first course related to IT. Our personal information is as follows:

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      <p>Over the course of teamworking, there were a lot of difficulties that we had to address. But we managed to pull it together and work on it. We managed to assign the task and work efficiently enough to come up with a presentable assignment. The most important thing is we tried our best.</p>
                      <P>Kien: Kien is a very dedicated person, he always tries to make sure that his work is done correctly before anything else. Kien’s project idea from previous assignments helped greatly in the creation of Right Journey. Kien is also good at keeping track of work and how the team is performing in general, which is very useful and makes him a reliable person to count on in such pressure situations.</p>
                      <p>Myself: we were met with a lot of pressure delving into this assignment, the sheer scope and ambitious nature of game development is heavy enough on its own, combined with the fact that we lack the knowledge to actually make a game and the endless number of things we had to work on is really difficult. But i think we did what we could for it despite the bads. My job was to divide tasks, keep track of everyone, work on the presentation slide, the first part of description, the website and the amount of work is overloading. The pressure in time is also a menace since the parts are interdependent. However, i think i did the best i can and utilize my abilities to its fullest. I would consider myself as a logical and precise person, so I try to keep things on track and transparent. Luckily, our team’s work, even in tough times, has been straight-forward and everyone understands their responsibility. If we were to redo the assignment, there would be changes for the better, but i can’t say that we haven’t tried.</p>
                      <p>Minh: Minh is also a very nice and chill guy. He is the one with the most experience in gaming and rpg. As such, he works on the nitty gritty of the game’s crucial part. He is also very creative which makes it even better as it is an essential characteristic to have in game development. His cheerful nature is also a source of inspiration for the team in times of difficulties as it lifts others' mood and helps us stay motivated.</p>
                      <p>Quang: Quang is the definition of a mediator. During our difficult times when we have disagreements on how the project should develop, Quang is the person who always tries to neutralize the situation and takes in everyone’s opinion. He’s also very sociable and outgoing which does help us out when we need outside opinions. As such, it’s fitting that he works on group process and communication.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                    <p>Over 10 weeks working with Khang, Minh and Kien, I realized that we have very good cooperation. After we assigned the tasks to each other, the whole team worked as a link to make the whole report very accurate. I feel very reassured to work with them because even if the task is heavy, with the members' support, we still perform excellently. And here are my personal reviews of each member:</p>
                    <P>My self: Our group consists of four members, which is a disadvantage compared to other groups because they have 5 members. Indeed, the amount of tasks we have to do is probably putting a lot of pressure on us. For me, my job is to help the team contribute ideas about building a game project, writing reports, designing presentations, and correcting each member's mistakes. As for contributing ideas to the project, I've come up with some ideas for building some of the characters in the game. In addition, I also support the members in the report to get the job done faster. More than that, I also adjusted the slide and arranged it logically to give a smoother presentation. I think I have done well in the parts that I have been assigned to and always be responsible for the efforts of the whole group. However, the pressure of time caused our group to have some unnecessary conflicts. I tried to listen to each member's opinion and encouraged me to try to bring them together. So throughout this project, I think our team has done it excellently, they always schedule a time to work on each content in the project. Each member of the group always contributes ideas and supports each other when needed.</p>
                    <P>Kien: Kien is a hard-working member, he always shows up on time when there are group meetings. Not only that, he always completes the assigned tasks early in the team and uses the remaining time to help and build ideas for this project. Kien has a great creative mindset in adding ideas to the game that makes it more engaging. These creative ideas are always in Kien's mind, which makes this game project different from games of the same genre on the market. I am very proud to have had an opportunity to work with Kien on this project.</P>
                    <p>Khang: Khang is one of the most careful members of the group. As a leader, he always knows the strengths and weaknesses of each team member and assigns tasks to best suit. He is the one who came up with the idea for this project through the experience of many games on the market. Decisions are always difficult, but always accept the comments of each individual in the group and choose the most appropriate idea. Moreover, he is very responsible in the process of working and contributing great ideas to perfect this project. Finally, he always helps me fix the mistakes in the report and helps me with some of the report when I have to prepare for the presentation. I am very happy to work with Khang and have learned a lot about leadership.</p>
                    <p>Minh: The last member is Minh, a cheerful, responsible, and experienced person in the group. Through understanding the genre of the game we are building, he is the one who built it to be most engaging with the player. From the smallest details such as sound, lighting and plot are also carefully and meticulously built. Furthermore, Minh also supported the team a lot in Web design for this report, which was one of the hardest and most time-consuming parts of our time. In short, Minh one person completed the job on time and its errors. I hope to also work with Minh in the next subjects.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      <p>I have worked with many groups before. However, this is the best group I worked with. After a course together, my group mates not only work together in the assignment, they actually help me a lot in understanding the course lecture and help me absorb the IT knowledge better. It is inevitable that sometimes we have different ideas and conflict has occurred. Yet, we were easily overcome. After this course, these group mates are not only someone I can call friends but they are going to be my bros.</p>
                      <p>Khang: When we chose a group leader, it was only a random pick in our group. However, after working together, Khang shows that he has real leadership potential by being a trustworthy guy. He cared for his teammate and he was the one to help us go through the IT knowledge. Moreover, he is responsible for the project, he always takes the heavy parts to help other team members, still he pushes all the team members to accomplish our goal faster and did not think much about himself. </p>
                      <p>Kien: Kien is also a hardworking person and he is responsible for all the work he is given. Moreover, he is always the one finishing the work fastest but the quality of his work is still guaranteed. Moreover, in all the group meetings, he is always the earliest one to come. I have to admit that our group has rubber timing but Kien always comes really early and calls the other team members so we can have on time meetings. Besides, he actually lifted up the group spirit by telling jokes, there were many funny moments when working with him.</p>
                      <p>Quang: After working with Quang, he is the most out-going and friendly person I have ever met. It is fair to say that he is the one who gathers all the group members together and connects us with each other. Our personalities might be different but Quang has helped us to get closer and understand each other more. As an introvert like me, thanks to Quang I was able to get into such an amazing group. Moreover, I have to say in our group, Quang is the one that works the hardest. He always goes to school and asks the SAS for the part that our group struggles with.</p>
                      <p>Myself: There is nothing much to say about myself. I did participate in the part that I was given and finished it on time. Moreover, I participated in all the group meetings. However, I feel that I still need to learn in IT and there are many things I have to learn from other group members as well.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      <p>For nearly ten weeks working together, it is hard to deny that there were many conflicts from different opinions to working styles occurring frequently. Nevertheless, we successfully managed and together overcame every obstacles. Eventually, as a solidary group, we were able to finish all the tasks and completed the report on time.</p>
                      <p>Khang: In my opinion, Khang is actually the leader of our team with great leadership ability. Indeed, he not only has a wide range of knowledge scale but shows a good attitude towards his teammates as well. In detail, he was the one to gather everyone, divide tasks and ensure everyone to follow the right way. Moreover, he usually pioneered in choosing difficult parts to do such as creating website or presentation slides, which can avoid work overloads for other three members.</p>
                      <p>Minh: Honestly, Minh has been my friend since we were in English class, so I understand him pretty well. In fact, he is very energetic with a high sense of humor, which becomes an inspiration factor of a whole team when we feel discouraged. Furthermore, he also proved that he is an expert in games, especially RPG when the majority of his games in the library was RPG genre. Hence, he showed a significant helpfulness in developing a game with the same genre.</p>
                      <p>Quang: Talking about Quang, he expresses as a kind and sociable person. With these personality traits, he is believed to be the mediator of our team. As Khang has mentioned above, whenever we had arguments, he would calm everyone down by conducting more positive views. In addition, his word is very persuasive and logical when explaining, which always makes him the first person to start the discussion and the last one to summarize it.</p>
                      <p>Myself: About my performance, I am confident to say that I have tried my best to contribute usefully to the group project. Specifically, I am always present when there are group meetings from online to offline. Although I did not provide many new ideas, I always listen carefully to what others say and discuss with them without hesitation. Moreover, in terms of using tools in our project, I knew how to use Unity and I was willing to whole-heartedly instruct other team members to make sure they knew how to use it properly. Besides, I usually made some funny stuff such as telling jokes or holding games with the aim of reducing stresses and pressures for my team, which help to increase our productivity.</p>

                          <p><b>Topic</b></p>
                          <p>
                            In this assignment, many project ideas were considered. We thought alot about which project to choose after looking into all of the members individual project ideas and feedback. At the initial stage, we were leaning towards the idea of a health monitoring and search database app. This app is a combination of Minh’s project idea and Khang’s project idea. To be specific it’s about an app that can help monitor the health of users through directly monitoring the blood pressure of the user and there’s also an search database for information on related health conditions for users to keep an eye on their well-being. However, this kind of project requires a lot of medical expertise which we don’t have. The capital required for the human resources on this matter however will be too much for us to properly handle. Our next consideration is of Kiên’s project which grew to our consensus. Upon developing the idea inspired from Kiên’s project, we decided to work on a RPG fighting/ puzzle indie game. The game will run on PC which with the operating system, will allow much more creative freedom and more variety in terms of visuals and animations. This topic resonates with us as we are all gamer enthusiasts at heart and game developing is always a prevalent aspect of IT. 
                          </p>
                          <p><b>Motivation</b></p>
                          <p>
                            The motivation for this project, as explained, comes from our mutual passion for gaming, especially for the rpg genres. We believe that this is an interesting project because gaming has always been an indispensable part of IT and as IT technology progresses, so do the games. This does not only apply for the visual aesthetic and animation aspect but also storytelling wise and character development. As such, the appeal of games are also greater year after year, breaking the negative social preconception that gaming is a bad thing and a waste of time. The global gaming market has gone a long way since its inception. Today, it’s valued at 162.32 billion USD (Mordor Intelligence 2020). This number is expected to rise to 295.63 billion USD by 2026. E-sport has also grown in terms of scale and attractiveness in comparison to past times. Especially, a huge opportunity to take advantage of the current situation is from the Covid pandemic. Because of the Covid-19 lockdown, people are advised to stay indoor and as such, the gaming industry has experienced tremendous growth as more people are getting into gaming (Smith 2020). For these reasons, A game development project will fill the demand of the current market perfectly. 
                          </p>
                          <p><b>Landscape</b></p>
                          <p>
                            As for landscape, there are a great variety of games out on the market at any point in time. However, only a few games actually became popular and successful. This year, Genshin impact was dubbed game of the year by Apple and Google (Tassi 2020). Genshin Impact is a rpg anime-style game which includes both traditional rpg elements and open world exploration puzzles. Genshin Impact successfully won this achievement while being a new game and has beat even long and established big players such as Call of Duty, FIFA, Assassin’s Creed. This is huge because it indicates that the gaming community’s preference is moving toward the classical genres of RPG, which signifies that our intended game does have an audience base and is in a good position to succeed. Furthermore, In the current market, there aren’t a lot of RPG games that combine both elements of dedicated fighting system and puzzle at the same time while also being indie. Usually, it tends to specialize in one or the other which may get repetitive and easy to substitute. This is also our unique selling point: As our game seamlessly combines the elements above, it really is one of a kind and leaves little room for competition. Our one big competitor is Genshin Impact. However, the game is anime style while ours is an indie, more on the lines of Undertale. Therefore, we don’t have to spend a fortune on developing visuals and we can also take up a niche market of our own, so it won’t affect us too heavily.

However, there is a game we got inspired by, which is Undertale, a game with many awards like best indie game of the year, best game story of the year. Therefore, we would like to develop an indie RPG (role playing games) puzzle game that is simple and can give the player a deep impression. There are several reasons we want to orientate our project this way. First, we feel that RPG is quite a popular game category and we want to add some puzzles to let the user improve logical thinking. Second, this is an indie game so the fund to develop it would not be too significant that we could afford it. Lastly, our group members deeply interest in video games, especially these game categories. Overall, the main purpose of this project is to finish and publish the game.</p>
                            <p>However, to accomplish this aim, we have quite some goal to achieve before we can reach the final one. The first step  we have to settle on is the storyline of the game because games are similar to movies which the only difference is we are a part of the story. Everyone wants to watch a movie with a rich story. Therefore, a good storyline for our game will be the first goal we have to achieve.</p>
                            <p>Next, one of the important things that make the game attractive is the characters and the world behind it. Graphics design will be the next goal we need to achieve. Every game needs a memorable character that could help the player feel into the story that they play. Moreover, as a RPG game, the main character will be the thing we focus more than others since it will be the character we spend our time with the most. The game’ world is also an important part as that will be the exploration part of the game for the player.</p>
                            <p>Then, music and sound design will be our next goal to achieve. Music and sound do not affect the way we play the game. However, it is important for us as it will push our emotions when we use music and sound effects in the right scenario. Moreover, music and sound are one of the elements to distinguish a better game since in every game award, this is a category to award. Moreover, many games can sell an extra soundtrack version to earn more so music is also a part we should focus on.</p>
                            <p>Gameplay, the element most of the players care the most for a game, is definitely one of our goals in the process. In the process of developing the gameplay, we also have to think about the puzzles for the game because this is also a puzzle game and it will be quite time consuming for creating the puzzles.</p>
                            <p>Since we have not had enough time and resources to complete all the goals we have mentioned perfectly and this is a video game project so actually we cannot only invest in one goal but we have to divind our resource to all the goals. If we have to prioritize a goal more than the others, the plot will be the part that we would focus more, then the music and sound are going to be the second most important part since they are the parts will push the emotion so the player have memorable moment with the game and it also one of the part make the game unique.  It is well-known that graphics and gameplay are also important for most of the games and many think that they are more important than the other 2 parts. Yet, we have our own reason to do this. First, this game is going to be an indie game and most indie games have a simple play style, thus we do not want to save our resources for the others. Second, about the graphics, we know our capability, even if we invest all our resources in the graphics it is not going to be even close to the graphics of those triple A games as the aspect of good graphics. Instead, we are not going to make good graphics but unique one. As our experiences in many indie games, they are relatively unique instead of having high resolution graphics and we want to follow this concept.</p>

                          </p>
                          <p><b>Plans and Progress</b></p>
                          <p>
                            <p>Before, each member in our group had different projects in assignment 2. However, as we worked together in assignment 3, we found that we have the same hobby and decided to take it in our project which is video games. Of course playing video games is different from actually making one. Therefore, we want to try ourselves in the area of video games developing. In addition, after discussion, we decided to make this game on the PC platform and if it is possible, we would like to try it on the console platform too. This project will be a challenge for us since we do not have any experience in developing games. This is the step that we think we will do to accomplish our goals.</p>
                            <p>First, we have to gather the information about the market trend and develop a game based on our survey. It is important to learn how the market wants because if we make a game, we want people to actually want to play it. Then, with the collected data base, we can develop the ideas of the game and program it. This will be an offline game so there will be no sign up required. </p>
                            <p>As for the project process, we have come to the part of game plot briefly so far. This game will talk about a dreaming mantis trying to gather its missing memories throughout the game to beat it. In order to do this, it has to jump from dreams to dreams and each dream will be an area to discover. In each area like that, the player will unlock a memory by solving the puzzle and earn different skills to play or unlock different areas. In each dream, there will be different NPCs, mobs and bosses. The number of mobs and bosses will change depending on how much resources we have. But as we plan, besides the unplanned battle bosses, there will be 3 big bosses which are “Vel the unicorn collector”, “Uel the dream plunder”,“Yel the rainbow destroyer” and a final boss which is “Hel the dream eater”. In order to finish the game, the player has to beat 3 big bosses to get the broken key then combine it to get access deeper to the “Dreame” world which is “Dreamee”. About the main character, it is a mantis without any memory, wake up and wander in an indefinite space. Then the player can control the character with a tutorial to teach them how to play. The player will learn how to move the character, how to use skills, add or replace skills and how to interact with the others. The tutorial will end at the moment the main character meets Gul the dream keeper which is a firefly. Gul will explain to Mantis everything about how the “Dreame” world works. This world is deeply connected to the human world and each time humans sleep, they generate energy for the world since the shape and formation of the world will generate based on the humans dreams. However, their nightmare will also become monsters in the “Dreame” world. In the dream, there will be pieces of memory. If the main character wants to find who it is, it has to gather and find its memories in those dreams. Defeat the mobs and minibosses will give pixie dust which is the currency to buy items from NPCs and upgrade your character. There will be many pieces of memory in the NPCs shopkeeper and it is optional to buy it to unlock full storyline and skill. Each piece of memory will reveal the story and a new skill. Moreover, the game is nonlinear so the player can go wherever they want and the game progress of each person will be different. However, there will be some areas that require different skills to go but this is how it works. The map will be close and all areas connected to other areas, so if we are in area A and want to go to area B but there is a “shallow gate”, to pass this gate we need an ability called “void dash” to pass it but we do not have it. Instead, we can go to the C area and D area to go to the B area. It does not matter how you play it as long as you meet the endgame condition which is to defeat 3 bosses and then the final, you can play whatever you want. In addition, the game will have several endings based on the player's decision throughout the game but we have not worked on the endings yet but we think there will be about 4 endings. We will work on the main character's story later so every time the memory will reveal a part of the main character’ story. Furthermore, we also want to make a story for every boss so each time we collect their memories, we can know about the bosses' plot. The game will mainly use the keyboard as the control tool or we can plug the controller in to play but there will be no mouse required.</p>

                          </p>
                          <p><b>Roles</b></p>
                          <p>
                            <p>Our group has 4 people: Kien, Quang, Khang, Minh. We decided to have a separate role for each person in the group to maximize the efficiency when working on the project. As for now, we quite have the same role which is to write the report together and generate the ideas for the project. However, in the future, the game project will need each person in charge of each profession field.</p>
                            <p>When we come to the part of actually developing the project, Kien will be in charge of sound and music design because he loves music and dreams to be a singer. To fulfil the role, Kien will make attracting music and soundtrack for the games and he will decide which part of the game will suit with each different sound throughout the game. Then, as Quang is the most out-going and friendly person in our group, he will be one who is in charge of public relations, he will collect the data from the market, find testing users to demo the game. Moreover, if the project can go further, he will make a game debut and events so people will know about the games. Next, Khang will be the graphic coordinator which will take care of the graphic, the characters and world design. In order to do this, Khang will grab a course of 2D design/animation to learn how to create things in games and he will learn the experience from other indie games concepts. Lastly, Minh will be the content writer, he will finish the rest of the game. Minh will have to finish the multi endings of the game and think of all the rest NPC and bosses in the game, along with all the coding. Our parts are strongly correlated to each other, so besides the individual work we are working on, we will work together to keep track of the progress and prevent any mistake. The programming part will be the part we do together because writing code will be a challenge if there is one person responsible for it.</p>

                          <p><b>Risks</b></p>
                          <p>
                            Regarding the risks involved in producing video games, it is believed to be unavoidable due to the high effort required and the possibility of failure even greater than success (Schmalz et al. 2014). With just a small error, the firm can suffer heavy financial losses and face complicated demands from its publisher in modifying project structure. However, by researching many online sources, we acknowledged that there are still plenty of ways to prevent risks occurring while developing. Also, we have listed three possible risks which are financial, requirements and technical risk. Firstly, as for “Financial” risk, it is asserted that customers will pay for your video game products depending on the value of both production and performance when taking it to the actual test (Cook 2006). Thus, it is essential to monitor this process properly whether it gains profit or suffers a loss so that we can decide the appropriate action for each circumstance. For instance, in terms of a loss, our business will stop producing this item immediately and invest in other more profitable ones. Secondly, “Requirements” risk is primarily aimed at the process of creating a decent game which can meet the needs of a variety of customers. This risk is divided into three interrelated sectors: design, scope and market. In the design section, understanding the fundamental concept of our game is imperative in order to program correctly and deliver the best in-game performance for target audiences. For both scope and market risk, these two are considered as external factors, requiring the programmer to have the foresight to prepare for changes in the marketplace that can diminish the game’s value. Last but not least, technical risk often happens when the core software does not interact effectively with others (Tozour 2013). The typical examples of technical risk can be listed such as path-finding, rendering engines, etc. Furthermore, it is proved that whenever new game features are added, it will make technical risks fluctuate strongly (Cook 2006). As we are trying to create a product that can exceed customer expectations, a small adjustment to the game mechanics can yield either excellent or disastrous results.
                          </p>
                          <p><b>Group process and communications</b></p>
                          <p>
                            Team-building plays a vital role in software development organizations nowadays due to the high complexity of projects makes them unattainable to individuals (Thomas et al. 2009). In order to pass this “Introduction to Information Technology” course, especially the final group assignment, me and three of my friends have joined together in a group. Additionally, it is believed that a good outcome in team projects is often due to great teamwork and interpersonal communication (Eswara 2019). Also, to form a successful team, members must be able to work cooperatively and utilize their own traits and skills, experiences in the assignment as well as adapt to everyone's working styles. As our team is aiming for an HD score in this last assignment, each team member including myself always gives the best effort to contribute ideas and knowledge in every group meeting. Although, we sometimes have different opinions or even go against the tide, however, we never have any conflict and instead, we clearly interpret our personal statement in the most detailed way alongside actively listening to other team members' feedback as well as comments whether it is a compliment or complaint. Moreover, we also created a private group chat on Facebook not only to discuss our group processes step by step but also to exchange information easier like files, research articles or images. Besides that, from the very beginning, we have set up a shared document on google to assign the tasks evenly for each person. Plus, to keep up with the deadline, we also hold face-to-face meetings twice a week or online calls if needed. These meetings are primarily focused on interacting, providing evaluation then finalizing our parts after a few days of work. In some cases, one of our team members gets very busy or some unfortunate thing occurs to them like a car accident or illness which keeps them away for a few days and has less contact with the group. We already agreed together that the absent person must ask the other members for help and explain the specific tasks, then when they came back they had to do another part.

                            Say a venture capitalist decides to invest in our game, that would be a huge progress and will absolutely help make our project become a reality. This is because funding is one of the biggest hurdles for us, due to the fact that we lack the necessary human resources to go all the way and make this game an actual published piece. If there's funding, the positions we will acquire are sound designer (audio engineer), art director, programmer (AI + game) and FX artist . As we are all International business major students, we can take care of the business side of things ourselves, such as management, pr, market research, raising capital and so on. About the technical aspects, In-game sounds and soundtracks are crucial to the immersion and realism of a game. This is especially true for indie games, in which sounds play a pivotal role in creating a vibe that is unique to the game. Therefore, we emphasize the necessity of having someone professional who understands these factors and has the knowledge, technical tools to create original soundtracks as well as ambient sounds and sound effects. On the same note, we also need an art director. Art direction is the bread and butter of indie games, it makes up the large portion of a player’s interest in a game. As experienced gamers we also understand compelling artwork and visuals but to create beauty consistently and throughout, we need the help of someone who’s specialized in it. As such, having an art director to handle all the details in this aspect is very important. From there on, we will also hire a FX artist. To any RPG and fighting game, movements and particle effects is a big selling point. Having stunning graphics is one thing, getting those graphics to perform actions and movement smoothly is another thing. This role is also too advanced and difficult for us to handle, as building real-time FX introduces a whole new level of difficulty compared to the ones in movies. Lastly, A programmer can aid us tremendously. A game programmer’s job is getting designs and assets to work in the game engine. Coding is the backbone of game development, a game can’t run reliably if codes are not well developed. A game full of bugs and glitches will damage our reputation and that could spell the end for a start-up game development group. Thus, having a reliable and experienced programmer is a must since there are so many elements in a game that needs their attention.

                                        As explained, there were many pressures put on the group. Pressure on time, pressure on development content, other deadlines and so on, but we tried our hardest. All-nighters were made, meetings were regular and we really put our heads together for this one. Generally speaking, whatever the outcome is, our teamwork was good.

                            I think there were a lot of things i could learn from this assignment. Some went well, some could be improved, but overall I think the team and I did our best for the assignment. The best thing about the team was the communication and exchanges. Everyone was very open to new ideas and liked to learn new things as well as taking on constructive criticism. You can really express yourself and add your opinion without fear. However, There were also lots of difficulties, we spent a lot of time considering which idea project to go with and had a lot of discussions before one conclusive project idea could be finalized. Timing was also a difficult issue because we are short on time and everyone’s schedule was different. This in combination with the fact that we are all third year students made it very challenging for us to work cohesively without being influenced by other deadlines. One thing that surprises me is how efficiently we can work even under pressure of time. The most important thing I learned through the experience is to be constructive and prepare early. As for the Github trail, I think the contribution information reflects our workload sufficiently, as I am in charge of creating the website. I ran into a problem on github however, where the name of the repo must match the user ID for the website to work.

                            After completing the 3rd exercise of Introduction to Information technology, I had a lot of time working with the team members, through which there were also strengths, weaknesses and surprises. In the following, I will present my responses to my team. First, these are good points; During the process from discussing ideas to presenting this project, we put responsibility first. It is an important factor in ensuring the team's progress is steady and the deadlines for each member are controlled. Fortunately for us, no one member made any mistakes. Furthermore, the work in groups is equally divided. Each member's dedication is recorded and listed in detail. Second, I want to talk about the weak points of the group. Perhaps under pressure of time and heavy workload led our team to have unreasonable conflicts leading to waste of time. Third, what surprised me the most about the White group was the deadlines. Although time is rushing, all jobs are handled in a timely manner. Also, we are not all IT students but the design of the Website makes us extremely proud. Through this task, I have learned a lot from other members such as Minh and Kien's creative web making ability; and Khang's leadership. Finally, for Github we have a clear assignment and the work is still on schedule.

                            Throughout the course, I have learned a lot about IT. Through the assignments, I can understand myself better by the personality test. Moreover, in assignment 2, I can know more about my teammate, what would an IT man do in the future so I will have the knowledge to prepare for the upcoming challenge. Overall, the course went pretty well for me, there is nothing that I want to complain about. This is my first course in IT, most of the knowledge in this course is new for me and I was surprised that coding for the web is much harder than I expected. One of the things that I have learned in the groups is that even our personalities might be different, but understanding each other is important and with enough sympathy and understanding, there will be no barrier between the members and we deal with any challenge. In addition, Github was extremely useful for our group. It helps us work together to keep track of each member's progress. Moreover, Github will help a lot in other IT projects in the future.

                            After completing this last assignment of IT course, I was able to build a strong bond with my teammates as well as broadening my knowledge in this field. Indeed, this course, where there were many teamwork activities, forced us to interact with others from meeting to doing projects. These helped us understand each member better, which not only strengthened our interpersonal skill but our relationship as well. In terms of IT skills, I had an opportunity to learn various new concepts such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and so on, which I found them such useful knowledge. Moreover, I also knew how to create my own website by writing code via application - Visual Studio Code (VSC), which was an interesting and novel experience. Moreover, it is hard to deny that conflicts were inevitable when we worked together. However, the thing that surprised me most was that everything went better than I expected when we got rid of our own egos and had a good cooperation to finish the project.  In addition, talking out using Github, I considered it as the secondary tool along with VSC to make our website accessible. Overall, I believe that we have worked well on those applications even though there were still some errors happening, sometimes.
