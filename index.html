                    <p class="mb-5">
                    <p>Over 10 weeks working with Khang, Minh and Kien, I realized that we have very good cooperation. After we assigned the tasks to each other, the whole team worked as a link to make the whole report very accurate. I feel very reassured to work with them because even if the task is heavy, with the members' support, we still perform excellently. And here are my personal reviews of each member:</p>
                    <P>My self: Our group consists of four members, which is a disadvantage compared to other groups because they have 5 members. Indeed, the amount of tasks we have to do is probably putting a lot of pressure on us. For me, my job is to help the team contribute ideas about building a game project, writing reports, designing presentations, and correcting each member's mistakes. As for contributing ideas to the project, I've come up with some ideas for building some of the characters in the game. In addition, I also support the members in the report to get the job done faster. More than that, I also adjusted the slide and arranged it logically to give a smoother presentation. I think I have done well in the parts that I have been assigned to and always be responsible for the efforts of the whole group. However, the pressure of time caused our group to have some unnecessary conflicts. I tried to listen to each member's opinion and encouraged me to try to bring them together. So throughout this project, I think our team has done it excellently, they always schedule a time to work on each content in the project. Each member of the group always contributes ideas and supports each other when needed.</p>
                    <P>Kien: Kien is a hard-working member, he always shows up on time when there are group meetings. Not only that, he always completes the assigned tasks early in the team and uses the remaining time to help and build ideas for this project. Kien has a great creative mindset in adding ideas to the game that makes it more engaging. These creative ideas are always in Kien's mind, which makes this game project different from games of the same genre on the market. I am very proud to have had an opportunity to work with Kien on this project.</P>
                    <p>Khang: Khang is one of the most careful members of the group. As a leader, he always knows the strengths and weaknesses of each team member and assigns tasks to best suit. He is the one who came up with the idea for this project through the experience of many games on the market. Decisions are always difficult, but always accept the comments of each individual in the group and choose the most appropriate idea. Moreover, he is very responsible in the process of working and contributing great ideas to perfect this project. Finally, he always helps me fix the mistakes in the report and helps me with some of the report when I have to prepare for the presentation. I am very happy to work with Khang and have learned a lot about leadership.</p>
                    <p>Minh: The last member is Minh, a cheerful, responsible, and experienced person in the group. Through understanding the genre of the game we are building, he is the one who built it to be most engaging with the player. From the smallest details such as sound, lighting and plot are also carefully and meticulously built. Furthermore, Minh also supported the team a lot in Web design for this report, which was one of the hardest and most time-consuming parts of our time. In short, Minh one person completed the job on time and its errors. I hope to also work with Minh in the next subjects.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5">
                      <p>I have worked with many groups before. However, this is the best group I worked with. After a course together, my group mates not only work together in the assignment, they actually help me a lot in understanding the course lecture and help me absorb the IT knowledge better. It is inevitable that sometimes we have different ideas and conflict has occurred. Yet, we were easily overcome. After this course, these group mates are not only someone I can call friends but they are going to be my bros.</p>
                      <p>Khang: When we chose a group leader, it was only a random pick in our group. However, after working together, Khang shows that he has real leadership potential by being a trustworthy guy. He cared for his teammate and he was the one to help us go through the IT knowledge. Moreover, he is responsible for the project, he always takes the heavy parts to help other team members, still he pushes all the team members to accomplish our goal faster and did not think much about himself. </p>
                      <p>Kien: Kien is also a hardworking person and he is responsible for all the work he is given. Moreover, he is always the one finishing the work fastest but the quality of his work is still guaranteed. Moreover, in all the group meetings, he is always the earliest one to come. I have to admit that our group has rubber timing but Kien always comes really early and calls the other team members so we can have on time meetings. Besides, he actually lifted up the group spirit by telling jokes, there were many funny moments when working with him.</p>
                      <p>Quang: After working with Quang, he is the most out-going and friendly person I have ever met. It is fair to say that he is the one who gathers all the group members together and connects us with each other. Our personalities might be different but Quang has helped us to get closer and understand each other more. As an introvert like me, thanks to Quang I was able to get into such an amazing group. Moreover, I have to say in our group, Quang is the one that works the hardest. He always goes to school and asks the SAS for the part that our group struggles with.</p>
                      <p>Myself: There is nothing much to say about myself. I did participate in the part that I was given and finished it on time. Moreover, I participated in all the group meetings. However, I feel that I still need to learn in IT and there are many things I have to learn from other group members as well.</p>

                          <p><b>Aims</b></p>
                          <p>
                            <p>Due to the development of technology, video games have become one of the essential entertaining tools for the world, especially the young generation. There are many game types which attract the teenager. However, there is a game we got inspired by, which is Undertale, a game with many awards like best indie game of the year, best game story of the year. Therefore, we would like to develop an indie RPG (role playing games) puzzle game that is simple and can give the player a deep impression. There are several reasons we want to orientate our project this way. First, we feel that RPG is quite a popular game category and we want to add some puzzles to let the user improve logical thinking. Second, this is an indie game so the fund to develop it would not be too significant that we could afford it. Lastly, our group members deeply interest in video games, especially these game categories. Overall, the main purpose of this project is to finish and publish the game.</p>
                            <p>However, to accomplish this aim, we have quite some goal to achieve before we can reach the final one. The first step  we have to settle on is the storyline of the game because games are similar to movies which the only difference is we are a part of the story. Everyone wants to watch a movie with a rich story. Therefore, a good storyline for our game will be the first goal we have to achieve.</p>
                            <p>Next, one of the important things that make the game attractive is the characters and the world behind it. Graphics design will be the next goal we need to achieve. Every game needs a memorable character that could help the player feel into the story that they play. Moreover, as a RPG game, the main character will be the thing we focus more than others since it will be the character we spend our time with the most. The gameâ world is also an important part as that will be the exploration part of the game for the player.</p>
                            <p>Then, music and sound design will be our next goal to achieve. Music and sound do not affect the way we play the game. However, it is important for us as it will push our emotions when we use music and sound effects in the right scenario. Moreover, music and sound are one of the elements to distinguish a better game since in every game award, this is a category to award. Moreover, many games can sell an extra soundtrack version to earn more so music is also a part we should focus on.</p>
                            <p>Gameplay, the element most of the players care the most for a game, is definitely one of our goals in the process. In the process of developing the gameplay, we also have to think about the puzzles for the game because this is also a puzzle game and it will be quite time consuming for creating the puzzles.</p>
                            <p>Since we have not had enough time and resources to complete all the goals we have mentioned perfectly and this is a video game project so actually we cannot only invest in one goal but we have to divind our resource to all the goals. If we have to prioritize a goal more than the others, the plot will be the part that we would focus more, then the music and sound are going to be the second most important part since they are the parts will push the emotion so the player have memorable moment with the game and it also one of the part make the game unique.  It is well-known that graphics and gameplay are also important for most of the games and many think that they are more important than the other 2 parts. Yet, we have our own reason to do this. First, this game is going to be an indie game and most indie games have a simple play style, thus we do not want to save our resources for the others. Second, about the graphics, we know our capability, even if we invest all our resources in the graphics it is not going to be even close to the graphics of those triple A games as the aspect of good graphics. Instead, we are not going to make good graphics but unique one. As our experiences in many indie games, they are relatively unique instead of having high resolution graphics and we want to follow this concept.</p>

                          <p><b>Plans and Progress</b></p>
                          <p>
                            <p>Before, each member in our group had different projects in assignment 2. However, as we worked together in assignment 3, we found that we have the same hobby and decided to take it in our project which is video games. Of course playing video games is different from actually making one. Therefore, we want to try ourselves in the area of video games developing. In addition, after discussion, we decided to make this game on the PC platform and if it is possible, we would like to try it on the console platform too. This project will be a challenge for us since we do not have any experience in developing games. This is the step that we think we will do to accomplish our goals.</p>
                            <p>First, we have to gather the information about the market trend and develop a game based on our survey. It is important to learn how the market wants because if we make a game, we want people to actually want to play it. Then, with the collected data base, we can develop the ideas of the game and program it. This will be an offline game so there will be no sign up required. </p>
                            <p>As for the project process, we have come to the part of game plot briefly so far. This game will talk about a dreaming mantis trying to gather its missing memories throughout the game to beat it. In order to do this, it has to jump from dreams to dreams and each dream will be an area to discover. In each area like that, the player will unlock a memory by solving the puzzle and earn different skills to play or unlock different areas. In each dream, there will be different NPCs, mobs and bosses. The number of mobs and bosses will change depending on how much resources we have. But as we plan, besides the unplanned battle bosses, there will be 3 big bosses which are âVel the unicorn collectorâ, âUel the dream plunderâ,âYel the rainbow destroyerâ and a final boss which is âHel the dream eaterâ. In order to finish the game, the player has to beat 3 big bosses to get the broken key then combine it to get access deeper to the âDreameâ world which is âDreameeâ. About the main character, it is a mantis without any memory, wake up and wander in an indefinite space. Then the player can control the character with a tutorial to teach them how to play. The player will learn how to move the character, how to use skills, add or replace skills and how to interact with the others. The tutorial will end at the moment the main character meets Gul the dream keeper which is a firefly. Gul will explain to Mantis everything about how the âDreameâ world works. This world is deeply connected to the human world and each time humans sleep, they generate energy for the world since the shape and formation of the world will generate based on the humans dreams. However, their nightmare will also become monsters in the âDreameâ world. In the dream, there will be pieces of memory. If the main character wants to find who it is, it has to gather and find its memories in those dreams. Defeat the mobs and minibosses will give pixie dust which is the currency to buy items from NPCs and upgrade your character. There will be many pieces of memory in the NPCs shopkeeper and it is optional to buy it to unlock full storyline and skill. Each piece of memory will reveal the story and a new skill. Moreover, the game is nonlinear so the player can go wherever they want and the game progress of each person will be different. However, there will be some areas that require different skills to go but this is how it works. The map will be close and all areas connected to other areas, so if we are in area A and want to go to area B but there is a âshallow gateâ, to pass this gate we need an ability called âvoid dashâ to pass it but we do not have it. Instead, we can go to the C area and D area to go to the B area. It does not matter how you play it as long as you meet the endgame condition which is to defeat 3 bosses and then the final, you can play whatever you want. In addition, the game will have several endings based on the player's decision throughout the game but we have not worked on the endings yet but we think there will be about 4 endings. We will work on the main character's story later so every time the memory will reveal a part of the main characterâ story. Furthermore, we also want to make a story for every boss so each time we collect their memories, we can know about the bosses' plot. The game will mainly use the keyboard as the control tool or we can plug the controller in to play but there will be no mouse required.</p>

                          </p>
                          <p><b>Roles</b></p>
                          <p>
                            <p>Our group has 4 people: Kien, Quang, Khang, Minh. We decided to have a separate role for each person in the group to maximize the efficiency when working on the project. As for now, we quite have the same role which is to write the report together and generate the ideas for the project. However, in the future, the game project will need each person in charge of each profession field.</p>
                            <p>When we come to the part of actually developing the project, Kien will be in charge of sound and music design because he loves music and dreams to be a singer. To fulfil the role, Kien will make attracting music and soundtrack for the games and he will decide which part of the game will suit with each different sound throughout the game. Then, as Quang is the most out-going and friendly person in our group, he will be one who is in charge of public relations, he will collect the data from the market, find testing users to demo the game. Moreover, if the project can go further, he will make a game debut and events so people will know about the games. Next, Khang will be the graphic coordinator which will take care of the graphic, the characters and world design. In order to do this, Khang will grab a course of 2D design/animation to learn how to create things in games and he will learn the experience from other indie games concepts. Lastly, Minh will be the content writer, he will finish the rest of the game. Minh will have to finish the multi endings of the game and think of all the rest NPC and bosses in the game, along with all the coding. Our parts are strongly correlated to each other, so besides the individual work we are working on, we will work together to keep track of the progress and prevent any mistake. The programming part will be the part we do together because writing code will be a challenge if there is one person responsible for it.</p>

                            Throughout the course, I have learned a lot about IT. Through the assignments, I can understand myself better by the personality test. Moreover, in assignment 2, I can know more about my teammate, what would an IT man do in the future so I will have the knowledge to prepare for the upcoming challenge. Overall, the course went pretty well for me, there is nothing that I want to complain about. This is my first course in IT, most of the knowledge in this course is new for me and I was surprised that coding for the web is much harder than I expected. One of the things that I have learned in the groups is that even our personalities might be different, but understanding each other is important and with enough sympathy and understanding, there will be no barrier between the members and we deal with any challenge. In addition, Github was extremely useful for our group. It helps us work together to keep track of each member's progress. Moreover, Github will help a lot in other IT projects in the future.
