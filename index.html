                          <p><b>Aims</b></p>
                          <p>
                            <p>Due to the development of technology, video games have become one of the essential entertaining tools for the world, especially the young generation. There are many game types which attract the teenager. However, there is a game we got inspired by, which is Undertale, a game with many awards like best indie game of the year, best game story of the year. Therefore, we would like to develop an indie RPG (role playing games) puzzle game that is simple and can give the player a deep impression. There are several reasons we want to orientate our project this way. First, we feel that RPG is quite a popular game category and we want to add some puzzles to let the user improve logical thinking. Second, this is an indie game so the fund to develop it would not be too significant that we could afford it. Lastly, our group members deeply interest in video games, especially these game categories. Overall, the main purpose of this project is to finish and publish the game.</p>
                            <p>However, to accomplish this aim, we have quite some goal to achieve before we can reach the final one. The first step  we have to settle on is the storyline of the game because games are similar to movies which the only difference is we are a part of the story. Everyone wants to watch a movie with a rich story. Therefore, a good storyline for our game will be the first goal we have to achieve.</p>
                            <p>Next, one of the important things that make the game attractive is the characters and the world behind it. Graphics design will be the next goal we need to achieve. Every game needs a memorable character that could help the player feel into the story that they play. Moreover, as a RPG game, the main character will be the thing we focus more than others since it will be the character we spend our time with the most. The game’ world is also an important part as that will be the exploration part of the game for the player.</p>
                            <p>Then, music and sound design will be our next goal to achieve. Music and sound do not affect the way we play the game. However, it is important for us as it will push our emotions when we use music and sound effects in the right scenario. Moreover, music and sound are one of the elements to distinguish a better game since in every game award, this is a category to award. Moreover, many games can sell an extra soundtrack version to earn more so music is also a part we should focus on.</p>
                            <p>Gameplay, the element most of the players care the most for a game, is definitely one of our goals in the process. In the process of developing the gameplay, we also have to think about the puzzles for the game because this is also a puzzle game and it will be quite time consuming for creating the puzzles.</p>
                            <p>Since we have not had enough time and resources to complete all the goals we have mentioned perfectly and this is a video game project so actually we cannot only invest in one goal but we have to divind our resource to all the goals. If we have to prioritize a goal more than the others, the plot will be the part that we would focus more, then the music and sound are going to be the second most important part since they are the parts will push the emotion so the player have memorable moment with the game and it also one of the part make the game unique.  It is well-known that graphics and gameplay are also important for most of the games and many think that they are more important than the other 2 parts. Yet, we have our own reason to do this. First, this game is going to be an indie game and most indie games have a simple play style, thus we do not want to save our resources for the others. Second, about the graphics, we know our capability, even if we invest all our resources in the graphics it is not going to be even close to the graphics of those triple A games as the aspect of good graphics. Instead, we are not going to make good graphics but unique one. As our experiences in many indie games, they are relatively unique instead of having high resolution graphics and we want to follow this concept.</p>
